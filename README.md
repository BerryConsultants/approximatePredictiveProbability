# Approximate Predictive Probability

code to implement the approximate predictive probability

Primary functions calculate a predictive probability based on interim data from a z-score, p-value, or posterior probability

helper functions assist in interim information calculation and conversions

For some endpoints, information is best specified as sample size, while others are best defined by exposure time or events. Please see the below table for details.
